4. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
6. When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.
8. After Knitting, submit the completed exercise (PDF file) to the dropbox in Sakai. Add your last name into the file name (e.g., "Lima_A01_Introduction.Rmd") prior to submission.

The completed exercise is due on <>.

## 1) Discussion Questions

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: I have experience with Git from John Fay's Geospatial Data Analytics
class but that was within a Python context. My R experience comes from John
Poulson's Stats class and if I'm being honest I don't remember much.

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I'm confident that I know the basics of Git, so versioning won't
be a problem.

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I'm very apprehensive about working in R. Even after John Poulson's 
class I don't feel like I know what I'm doing. I think that because I was
learning statistics and coding simultaneously I didn't retain much of either.


## 2) GitHub

Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository  and that you have updated your course README file.
